The FBgn0031208 gene has 5 exons in the original annotation file (i.e. `Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.25.62.chr.gtf`)
and only 4 counting bins in the flattened one (i.e. `Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.25.62.chr_dexseq_noaggregate.gff`). 
Following inspection of the annotated transcripts in [Ensembl 62](http://apr2011.archive.ensembl.org/Drosophila_melanogaster/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=FBgn0031208;r=2L:6687-10326), we can explain how the initial exons break down into 4 different counting bins.
