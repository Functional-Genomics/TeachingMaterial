From the QA report we can learn that the quality in our fastq file was encoded using the Sanger/Illumina 1.9 format and using the information in Wikipedia we can see that this corresponds to phred 33.

Alternatively, we could try to automatically determine the format of the quality encoding by using other available tools (e.g. [DetermineFastqQualityEncoding](http://www.mcdonaldlab.biology.gatech.edu/seqtools_frame.htm) - not tested).
