## Visualising aligned reads
Several genome browsers exist to visualise the files generated during the analysis of high-troughput sequencing data, including BAM files. Two of the most popular tools are [IGV](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) and [Tablet](http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/). In this practical we will be using IGV to visualise our BAM file. We can launch this tool from the *Download* section in the [project website](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/download).

Once the interface is loaded, we can proceed to load the necessary files. In our case, we will load the following information:

* the reference genome:

    ```
    Genomes > Load genome from file > 
        reference/Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.25.62.dna_rm.toplevel.fa
    ```
* the BAM file:

    ```
    File > Load from file > data/mapped/untreated3.bam

    # IGV requires the BAM file to be indexed, which can be achieved with samtools 
    #   (i.e. `samtools index bam_file)
    # For this practical the index is already provided, so there is no need to run this command
    ```  
* the annotation:

    ```
    File > Load from file > reference/Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.25.62.gtf
    ```

**Exercise:** Spend some time exploring the loaded BAM file and how the reads overlap with the known annotation. Can you find examples of split and spliced reads? For a subset of the reads, some nucleotides are highlighted in a different color. What do you think the explanation for this is?
